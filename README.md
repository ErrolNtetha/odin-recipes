Building a project where i am creating a recipe and make use of what i have learned
so far which is working with different tags. The recipe project has to have 
an ordered list and unordered list as well just to show that i have understood the concepts.

I have learned that an image tag has at least 2 attributes, one for alt(alternative text u
in case of the image not showing in the DOM, and also the the src attribute for 
inserting the image link, and inserting images to display them image in the DOM. I have also gained an
understanding of the difference between the "Absolute" and "Relative" links.
